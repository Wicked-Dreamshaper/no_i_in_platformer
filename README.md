# No i in Platformer

This is my entry for Game Maker's Toolkit Jam 2018: https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2018
The theme of the jam is "Genre, without Mechanic", filling in the gaps for Genre and a notable mechanic from that genre.

So my entry is the concept of a platformer but without vision. Vision is a pretty important mechanic from a lot of genres, but I hope this idea is interesting enough to be worth looking at (or not, for the most part).
Give it a try. Hope you have fun.
